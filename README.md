> The constructor for a custom element is not supposed to read or write its DOM. It shouldn't create child elements, or modify attributes. That work needs to be done later, usually in a connectedCallback() method.

> In general, work should be deferred to connectedCallback as much as possibleâ€”especially work involving fetching resources or rendering. However, note that connectedCallback can be called more than once, so any initialization work that is truly one-time will need a guard to prevent it from running twice.
